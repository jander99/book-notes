# How to Interest People #

## Principle: "Talk in terms of the other person's interests."

- Study the other person's interests in order to connect with them in conversation. 
- "The way to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most."
- Break the ice and establish a rapport with the person by talking about what interests them. 
- Someone who is 'warmed up' might offer better results when you present them a question or problem.
