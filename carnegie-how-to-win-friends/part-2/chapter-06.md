# How to Make People Like You Instantly #

## Principle: "Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely."

- Find someone you honestly admire about a person. 
- "Radiate a little happiness" as an unselfish act of appreciation, not because you want something.
- Make people feel important, the urge "has been responsible for civilization itself."
- Apply 'The Golden Rule' to conversation. 
- Attention, interest, praise, and feelings of importance are things to give.
- Start a conversation with politeness, oil the cogs. 
- "Every man I meet is my superior in some way." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
- Admiration is something people crave but rarely receive. It can help to find common interests.
