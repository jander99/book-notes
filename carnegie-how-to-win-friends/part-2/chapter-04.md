# An Easy Way to Become a Good Conversationalist #

## Principle: "Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves."

- Be an "interested listener." People wants to share things about themselves and have someone listen. 
- Be truthful in your conversation but praise them during the conversation. 
- Body language can show you are actively listening. Face the speaker and maintain eye contact. 
- Don't interrupt or irritate speakers, as that will just inflame awkward situations. 
- When you stop what you're doing to listen to a spouse or child you are showing their importance to you.
- People don't always want advice, they just want someone to listen, 'Verbal venting' to someone they trust.
