# If you Don't Do This, You Are Headed for Trouble #

## Principle: "Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language." 

- Remember someone's name and a couple of details about their personal life. It's a compliment. 
- People palce an astounding importance on their own name. Companies, Museum Collections, Buildings, etc are named after people as a way to perpetuate their names. 
- Remembering coworkers names can make a work atmosphere warmer.
- People don't remember names because they don't make the effort to do so. FDR learned names of mechanics who visited the White House and if the President can, then so can anyone. 
- Repeat the name, ask how it's spelled, write it down, concentrate on it, or study it in order to remember it.
