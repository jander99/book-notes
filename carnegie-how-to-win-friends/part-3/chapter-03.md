# Chapter 3 - If You're Wrong, Admit It #

## Principle: "If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically." ##

- If you often admit that you're wrong, others might show some sympathy and criticize you less.
- Accept self-criticism, it's easier than hearing it from someone else.
- The only way to resolve some differences is to swallow your pride and admit you're wrong.
- "By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected."
