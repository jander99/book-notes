# An Appeal That Everybody Likes #

## Principle: "Appear to the nobler motives." ##

- People think they are unselfish.  
- Two reasons for doing something: the good reason and the real reason
- A motive that sounds good and make someone else look good or noble will be more likely to be followed
- If you aren't happy with results, you have nothing to lose by trying something new.  
- Experiment by challenging people to live up to their selves.  
- Assumption: People are sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay their debts/obligations.
- Give people the benefit of the doubt
