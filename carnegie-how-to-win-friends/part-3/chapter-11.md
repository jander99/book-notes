# The Movies Do It. TV Does It. Why Don't You Do It? #

## Principle: "Dramatize your ideas." ##

- Capture your audience's attention by presenting information in a dramatic way
- "The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship."
- TV ads dramatize the advantages offered by whatever is for sale and convinces people to buy.
