# When Nothing Else Works, Try This #

## Principle: "Throw down a challenge." ##

- Competition can stimulate productivity and motivate people to achieve.  
- Difficult tasks can be an enticement to prove they can overcome them.
- The work itself is what motivates, not money, benefits, or working conditions. [I challenge this.]
- People will work hard and do a good job is the job is exciting and interesting.  
- Desire to excel and desire to feel important are motiviations.  
- People want to show their talents.
