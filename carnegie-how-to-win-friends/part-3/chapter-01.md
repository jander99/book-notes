# Chapter 1 - You Can't Win an Argument #

## Principle: "The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it." ##

- Determine when it is best to correct someone, don't correct someone or argue about a topic simply to feel important or superior.
- "Winning" an argument typically means you've lost goodwill with the other person because of feelings of resentment. You aren't likely to change someone's mind in this way
- "The customer is always right" even when they are wrong is a natural extension to this, as typically the phrase is used when there is an argument.
- If you can't employ reason and use facts, try to agree and show appreciation because you don't need to invalidate their position to get them to change it.
  - For instance, letting someone talk out their position before responding allows them to feel heard
- Choose your battles.
- Distrust any first impression; instinct is not always right. Follow up logically instead of becoming defensive.
- Give a position that could invoke an argument a fair chance to be explained.
- Find points where both arguers agree. There is always some middle ground to start from.
- Honesty is the best policy. If you're wrong about something, apologize to those who may have felt wronged.
- People want to be heard. Let them speak and listen for any points or trains of thought that you might not have thought about.
- Be sure to thank a debate opponent if they seem actually interested in the topic.
- If there is debate and ideas can't be quickly reconciled, give yourself and your opponent time to think about each side of the argument instead of being reactionary in the moment.
