# How to Get Cooperation #

## Principle: "Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers." ##

- People like their own ideas more than those of other people
- People don't like to be told what to do.
- Asking for approval creates a sense of ownership
- Ask people what they need and fulfill only that need
- Asking for feedback makes people feel important
- Drop hints to plant ideas in someone's head, let them think about it on their own
  - Given enough time they might feel like they thought of it themselves
- Does it matter who gets credit for an idea if you're looking for results?
