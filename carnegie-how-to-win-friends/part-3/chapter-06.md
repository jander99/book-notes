# The Safety Valve in Handling Compaints #

## Principle: "Let the other person do a great deal of the talking" ## 

- Listen patiently
- Let other people express themselves completely, don't jump in. 
- Interrupting will get people to continue thinking about their ideas rather than be open to listen to yours
- Listen with a sincere and open mind; make them feel heard. 
- Talk less about yourself and listen more to those around you
