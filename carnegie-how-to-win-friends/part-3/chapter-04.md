# A Drop of Honey # 

## Principle: "Begin in a friendly way."

- Agression toward someone else begets aggression toward you. 
- Don't let your temper get the best of you
- A friendly tone can win over enemies.
- You might see compromise from others if you present in an agreeable manner and look for common ground
- Compliments and helpful information can make someone more likely to consider your point of view
- "A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall." - Abraham Lincoln
