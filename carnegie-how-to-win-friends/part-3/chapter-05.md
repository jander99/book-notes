# The Secret of Socrates #

## Principle: "Get the other person saying 'yes, yes' immediately" ##

- Emphasize the points that you and your opponent agree on. 
- Resolve the issue and reach an agreement
- Ask questions your opponents has to agree with. 
  - Yes: Produces a positive mindset
  - No: Makes people withdraw from conversation
- Ultimatums do not create a welcoming feeling
- Talk about what the other person wants, get them to start saying 'yes'
- Don't argue with customers, look at a matter from their point of view 
- Socrates used the 'yes' method to win debates
