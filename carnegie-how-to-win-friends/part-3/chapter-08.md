# A Formula That Will Work Wonders for You #

## Principle: "Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view." ##

- Understand rather than condemn; nobody thinks they are wrong.
- Discover the reasons behind why someone thinks the way they do.
- People are only interested in themselves
- The other person's ideas and feelings are as important as your own.
- Be respectful and tactful to people rather than threatening them from authority
- Win people over to your way of thinking rather than forcing them to "obey orders"
- Anticipate someone else's point of view before the conversation
