# Chapter 2 - A Sure Way of Making Enemiesâ€”and How to Avoid It #

## Principle: "Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, 'You're wrong.'" ##

- Stark disagreements create resentment. People will resist speaking to you about something if the response is always criticism and are unlikely to change their mind.
- Utilize polite phrases like "I maybe be wrong..."
- People tend to operate with biases, they don't want to change their minds because they cling to their beliefs.
- Attempt to understand statements rather than judge the speaker on them.
- Avoid coming across as a know-it-all. "I imagine" is a good way to soften assertions.
- Point out that the other person might be right, disagree respectfully instead of simply taking pleasure in the argument itself.
- Lead listeners to discover the ideas you're trying to present so they can work through the information themselves and hopefully come to an appropriate conclusion.
- In a customer-centric setting, never attempt to 'win an argument' as that will result in a loss of business. Ask friendly questions to get to the truth of the matter.
