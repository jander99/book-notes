# Chapter 3 - He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way

## Principle: "Arouse in the other person an eager want."  

- "Bait the hook to suit tthe fish." - Since people want what _they_ want you have to find a way to make what _you_ want to be what _they_ want. 
- Giving a list of positives and negatives in a particular situation could help you persuade others that your way is advantageous for them
- Understand the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle
- When trying to communicate, such as with writing a letter to a customer, make sure the perspective is from the customer's point of view in order to be more effective. 
- Don't try to "sell" your product (or service) but rather show how the product (or service) solves a problem for the prospective buyer, then the buyer will want it. 
- Children and workplace peers react positively to the same methods of influence
