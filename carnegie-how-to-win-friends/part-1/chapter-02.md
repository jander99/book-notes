# Chapter 2 - The Big Secret of Dealing with People

## Principle: "Give honest and sincere appreciation."

- Make people want to do the things you want them to do
- People want to feel important. The feeling of importance is not easily fulfilled. 
- People crave appreciation
- People want to be encouraged
- Praise instead of condemn because otherwise you only end up discouraging the condemned
- Flattery is insincere while appreciation is genuine. People can spot the bullshit. 
- If criticism is necessary it should be done in a way that doesn't hurt them
