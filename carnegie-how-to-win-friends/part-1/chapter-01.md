# Chapter 1 - If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive

## Principle: "Don't criticize, condem or complain."  

- People who are considered to be bad do not necessarily consider themselves to also be bad; they do not critize themselves. 
- Criticism is futile. Negative comments cause resentment and put people on the defensive. 
- Animals learn better with positive reinforcement; the same applies to humans.
- We thirst for approval. 
- Write down the things that frustrate you and then don't do anything with it. 
- Change yourself before you try to change others
- Reaction to criticism is emotional because of pride and vanity therefore criticism has no place in Logic
- Parents shouldn't criticize children because of lack of experience.
