# How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment #

## Principle: "Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to." ##

- Earn a person's respect and show them you respect their abilities, then you can better lead them or change their minds
- "Act as though that particular trait were already" shown to incentivize someone to show more of that trait. They will strive to live up to the hype.
- Believe in people and they will believe in themselves. The smallest word of praise can change someone's life.
