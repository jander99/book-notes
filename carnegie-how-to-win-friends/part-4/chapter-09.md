# Making People Glad to Do What You Want #

## Principle: "Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest." ##

- Make someone feel important. Suggest when asking them to do something that it's a favor or an honor.
- Be tactful in words and actions
- Incentivize motivation. Strike bargains that benefit you and the other person, so you both gain something.
- If you have to turn down a request to help, try to offer another person who might be able to help.
- People like to feel they have some authority in their work. An official-sounding title can motivate someone to do their best.
- Be sincere and clear when trying to change someone's attitude. 
- People wont' always react well to your requests, but most of the time you're get better results and be a better leader anyway
