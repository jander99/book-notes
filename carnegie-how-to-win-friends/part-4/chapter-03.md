# Talk About Your Own Mistakes First #

## Principle: "Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person." ##

- Take a moment to remember your own mistakes before criticizing someone else.  
- Factor in the other person's age and experience.  
- Admitting your own mistakes can help the other person feel more comfortable and less judged.  
- Humility and praise will work veritable miracles in human relations.
