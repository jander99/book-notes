# No One Likes to Take Orders #  

## Principle: "Ask questions instead of giving direct orders." ##  

- Let people figure out their own way instead of telling them what to do.  
- Give people a feeling of importance by letting them make decisions and learn from their own errors.  
- "Do you think that would work?" can be used to offer an opinion indirectly.  
- Asking questions makes an order more palatable and allows a person's creativity to shine through.  
- People are more likely to rise to the occasion when they can give their opinion.
