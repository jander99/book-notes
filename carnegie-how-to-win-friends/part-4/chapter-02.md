# How to Criticize - and Not Be Hated for It #  

## Principle: "Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly" ##  

- Do not use 'but' when transitioning from praise to criticism.  
- Use 'and' statements instead, an flip the criticism from a negative to a possible 'what if...'  
- Negative criticism is still there but is given indirectly  
- Sensitive people may resent direct criticism  
- Leave the choice for a person to change their behavior up to them.
