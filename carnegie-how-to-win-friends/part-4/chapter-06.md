# How to Spur People On to Success #  

## Principle: "Praise the slightest improvement and priase every improvement. Be 'hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.'" ##  

- Praising improvement leads to further improvement and motivation.  
- People are quick to criticize yet reluctant to priase.  
- Praise can encourage perseverance.  
- B.F. Skinner on offering praise and minimizing criticism: "The good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy."  
- Cite specific acomplishments rather than making general flattery.  
- Showing belief in someone or acknowledging their good qualities can spark a person to change.  
- "Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement."
