# How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment #

## Principle: "Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct." ##

- Someone will become more discouraged and give up if you emphasize their mistakes, even if you're being honest with them. 
- Make something new seem easy to encourage someone to try that thing. Faith in their ability is another strong incentive for people to try new things. 
- Helping people to see the personal benefits they will gain will motivate them.
